# PyBer_Analysis

Overview of the analysis: This analysis fully employed the groupby function to permit a higher level of analysis through aggregates that reflect business critical understanding of the data at the city type level: rural, suburban and urban.

Consistent use of the groupby function across the same categories also enables the creation of a summary table that provides a "topline" view of key metrics that are useful when producing multiple-line charts or trends across metrics that represent a complete understanding of the business.

The purpose of the new analysis is well defined. (3 pt)
Results: The purpose of the analysis was to compare how total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver compare across rural, suburban, and urban city types. The trends that came through in the following metrics painted a strategic understanding of the patterns that define how PyBer should approach different types of cities.

  1) Total number of rides for each city type
  2) Total number of drivers for each city type
  3) Sum of the fares for each city type
  4) Average fare per ride for each city type
  5) Average fare per driver for each city type

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)

Summary: Rural cities don't use PyBer as much as either suburban or urban cities. Much fewer drivers offer rides in rural areas than in suburban or urban areas. As a result of both of these factors, the total fares from rural cities is smaller than both suburban and urban cities. However, the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver is higher for rural cities than for urban or suburban cities. Indicating that when a ride is taken by a user that its typically longer than the distance traveled by a suburban or urban user. These drivers get markedly higher fares than suburban or urban drivers.

Suburban cities had 5 times more rides than rural cities and over 5 time more drivers. This explains why their total fares are more than 4 times higher than rural cities. But suburban city drivers earn about $3.5 less on the average ride than rural drivers. Suburban drivers also on average earn $15 less than their rural counterpart.

Urban drivers make up the majority of rides, drivers, and overall fares. However, the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver is lower since those rides are probably shorter than the rides in less dense suburban/rural cities. The larger number of drivers also helps explain why the despite having higher total fares for the period, that the average fare per driver is the lowest of all city types.

Over the course of the period urban fares rose and fell week over week more so than suburban or rural cities. Weekly fares for each city type remained within a consistent band throughout the period. More often than not urban and suburban fares follow the same trend upwards or downward change for any given week's fare total.

There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4 pt)
1) The needs of rural cities are distinct and depending on how PyBer's service rates are structured they should consider lowering them slightly in order to review if a higher level of rides will produce higher overall total fares and or more rides.

2) The need for rides in urban areas is strong and does keep drivers busy. However when compared to the suburban areas, however the larger number of rides and total drivers produces only a relatively lower increase in the overall total fares. Together these metrics and the much lower average fare per driver indicate a saturation of drivers in the urban areas. Depending on the proximity to the urban areas, there may be cause to lure the drivers to service the suburban areas instead of just staying in the urban areas.

3) Suburban cites produce the higher average fares per ride and higher average fare per driver. Driving and owning a car in suburban areas is a way of life. The number of drivers and total rides in the suburban areas is a fraction of those in urban areas. Growing the number of total rides and drivers should be the focus in the suburban areas. Finding ways to encourage car owners to use their service more frequently instead of their personal car is probably central increasing the frequency of use by suburban users.

Net-net: The suburbs is where the growth in overall revenue may be strongest.
